# Feeling Nothing

Derived from https://github.com/jadetyers/halcyon - the core display and playback is largely unchanged, but all interactivity has been removed, making this an entirely passive experience and source of endless, soulless ambient chiming.

This is intended as the default web site of a new music project and may be expanded with a little more randomness.
